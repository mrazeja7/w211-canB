# w211-canB
my first try at carhacking.

The goal is to tap into a Mercedes-Benz W211 E class's CAN B bus to use the steering wheel buttons to control audio playback (fwd, back, pause) via a CH-06 bluetooth module connected to a cell phone.

Another goal is to operate the motorised door to the CD changer compartment in the center console, which stops working once a the original head unit is removed.

Hardware used:

Chinese Arduino Nano knock-off (CH340G)

MCP2515 ISP-CAN interface

CH-06 serial-Bluetooth interface
